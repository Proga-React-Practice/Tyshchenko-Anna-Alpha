      text:' The Renaissance in music began in northern Europe with the Burgundian school, which simplified the complex ars subtilior style. Influential figures like Guillaume Dufay spread this clearer polyphony across Europe. Advances in notation and printing unified musical styles continent-wide. The period ended with the Florentine Cameratas creation of opera, marking the transition to the Baroque era.'
